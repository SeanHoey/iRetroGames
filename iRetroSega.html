  <font face ="quartz ms">The Sega Genesis is a fourth-generation video game console developed and produced by Sega. It was originally released in Japan in 1988 as Mega Drive, then in North America in 1989 as Sega Genesis, and in Europe, Australia and other PAL regions in 1990 as Mega Drive. The reason for the two names is that Sega was unable to secure legal rights to the Mega Drive name in North America. The Sega Genesis is Sega's third console and the successor to the Sega Master System with which it has backward compatibility.
  The Sega Genesis was the first of its generation to achieve notable market share in Europe and North America. The Sega Genesis was launched to compete with the Nintendo Entertainment System and NEC's PC-Engine. Two years later, Nintendo released the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, and the competition between the two would dominate the 16-bit era of video gaming. The console began production in Japan in 1988 and ended with the last new licensed game being released in 2002 in Brazil. The Sega Genesis was Sega's most successful console; though Sega has never released a total sales figure quote, sales estimates in the past have ranged from as low as 29 million to over 40.8 million.</font>

<img src="Sega Megadrive\sonic.png" alt="sonic" height="250px" align="left"/>
<font face ="quartz ms">In the game, Sonic must prevent Doctor Robotnik from collecting the six Chaos Emeralds in an attempt to rule South Island. The player controls Sonic as he traverses six zones, each of which is split into three "Acts". At the end of the third act of each zone, the player faces Dr. Robotnik in one of his vehicles.
The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speeds with levels that include springs, slopes, high falls and loop-de-loops. Hazards the player experiences include a wide variety of badniks, animals trapped inside mechanical bodies. The player must also avoid rows of sharp spikes, bottomless pits, and other obstacles. Sonic's main means of defending himself is the Spin Attack, which can be performed by jumping in the air, or by pressing down on the D-Pad whilst moving on the ground.
Scattered around each level map are gold rings, a signature item of the Sonic series. Collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings act as a layer of protection against hazards as long as Sonic is holding at least one ring, dropping them if he is hit by an obstacle or enemy. However, if he is hit without holding any rings, the player loses a life. Shields and temporary invincibility can also be collected in order to provide additional layers of protection; however, they do not prevent the player from losing a life if Sonic is crushed by a trap, drowned, falls into a pit, or spends over ten minutes in an Act.</font>

<font face ="quartz ms">After the events of Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic and Tails descend back to the earth after Sonic destroyed the Death Egg. Sonic, as Super Sonic, runs into Knuckles who steals away all the Chaos Emeralds, having been tricked by Dr. Robotnik into believing that Sonic is to be treated as an enemy. Sonic and Tails head out once again to collect the emeralds back from Dr. Robotnik who has teamed up with Knuckles.
The story itself is split into 2 parts, with the second part of Sonic 3 being concluded in. Sonic &amp; Knuckles. The game can be slotted into the Sonic &amp; Knuckles game cartridge and continued directly from the Sonic 3 game save. Slotting Sonic 3 into Sonic &amp; Knuckles also gave players the chance to play as Knuckles through Sonic 3 and Tails to play through Sonic &amp; Knuckles. Additionally, if the player collects all 7 Chaos Emeralds and then all 7 Super Emeralds aswell, Sonic and Knuckles can change into Hyper Sonic and Hyper Knuckles, and Tails into Super Tails.</font>

<br/>
<br/>
<font face ="quartz ms">The game is set in Ancient Persia. While the Sultan is fighting a war in a foreign land, his vizier Jaffar seizes power. Jaffar's only obstacle to the throne is the Sultan's daughter. Jaffar locks her in a tower and orders her, under threat of execution, to become his wife. The game's nameless protagonist, whom the Princess loves, is thrown into the palace dungeons. To win the game the player must lead the protagonist out of the dungeons and to the palace tower, defeating Jaffar and freeing the Princess in under 60 minutes.
The character of Jaffar is loosely based on Ja'far bin Yahya Barmaki, a Persian vizier who was executed for allegedly having an affair with a princess. He is a recurring character in the Arabian Nights and elsewhere in film and literature.</font>

<img src="Sega Megadrive\Mortal Kombat.jpg" alt="Mortal Kombat" height="250px" align="left"/>
<font face ="quartz ms">Mortal Kombat was fighting games that had characters with considerable differences in speed, height, attacks, strength, jumping heights and distances, the characters in Mortal Kombat played virtually identically to one another (with the exception of unplayable characters), with only minimal differences in their moves' range and speed. The controls consisted of five buttons arranged in an "X" pattern: a high punch, a high kick, a low punch, a low kick, and a block button, as well as an eight-way joystick. If the two fighters were standing next to each other, hitting any of the attack buttons would result in a modified strike: a low punch turned into a throw, a high punch turned into a heavy elbow, head butt, or backhand, and either kick turned into a knee strike. Crouching and hitting a punch button resulted in an uppercut, which was one of the most damaging attacks in the game. Although leg sweeps and roundhouse kicks were performed by holding away while pressing the appropriate kick button.
The characters in Mortal Kombat differed mostly in their special moves and finishing moves. The game also changed the way special moves were performe only a few of the special moves required circular joystick movement. One of the things that's separated us from other fighting games is the crazy moves we've put in it, like fireballs and all the magic moves, so to speak. Another of the game's innovations was the Fatality, a special finishing move executed against a beaten opponent to kill them in a gruesome fashion. For example, Sub-Zero would grasp a defeated opponent by the head, then rip out the head and spine while the body fell to the ground in a pool of blood.</font>

<img src="Sega Megadrive\200full.jpg" alt="Pac-Mania" height="250px" align="left"/>
</br>
<font face ="quartz ms">The objective of Pac-Mania is to score as many points as possible. The player controls Pac-Man and attempts to eat all the dots in a maze, while avoiding being caught by ghosts that roam the maze. The player can eat power pellets that cause the ghosts to turn dark blue and become vulnerable; the player can then eat these ghosts for extra points, sending them back to their pen to return to their original colour and behaviour.
Pac-Mania contains several new features and significant differences from its original counterpart. The most noticeable change is the view used, cabinet projection, an oblique pseudo-3D format, in which Pac-Man always occupies the center of the screen and a virtual camera moves around the level to follow him. In addition, the player can press a button to cause Pac-Man to bounce, allowing him to evade most ghosts by bouncing over them. However, Pac-Man cannot as easily bounce over the green and steel gray ghosts because they bounce whenever the player presses the bounce button.</font>

<img src="Sega Megadrive\Road Rash.jpg" alt="Road Rash" height="250px" align="left"/>
<font face ="quartz ms">Road Rash was a racing game that introduced an interactive race environment, with street signs, trees, poles, and livestock, which could interact with the player's vehicle.[1] This was also one of the earlier games to feature active traffic, which created a more immersive and realistic environment, as the player had to contend with slow moving station wagons and the like while racing against other bikers. Aside from high speed, big-air, and spectacular crashes, what separated Road Rash from other racing games was its combat element. The player could fight other bikers with a variety of hand weapons or kick away other racers. The player would initially start off with just his or her hands and feet, but if the gamer timed a punch right, he or she could grab a weapon from another rider. The weapons themselves ranged from clubs, crowbars, nunchaku, and cattle prods. Fights between riders to knock each other off the bike would often go on at high speeds through traffic, pedestrians and roadside obstacles, with the victor gaining place and the loser sustaining bike damage and losing time.</font>
